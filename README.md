# Renata-PLC
Renata PLC is a full-stack web application for an Analytical Dashboard. The frontend uses JavaScript (React.js) to display dynamic bar charts with data fetched from a public Google Sheet in CSV format. The backend, built with Node.js, processes the data, enabling interactive data visualization without a database.
